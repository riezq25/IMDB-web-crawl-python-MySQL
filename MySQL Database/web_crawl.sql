His father was of Irish descent and his mother was of Irish and German ancestry.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the largest and most powerful studio in Hollywood when Gene Kelly arrived in town in 1941. He came direct from the hit 1940 original Broadway production of \"Pal Joey\" and planned to return to the Broadway stage after making the one film required by his contract. His first picture for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer wasFor Me and My Gal(1942) withJudy Garland. What kept Kelly in Hollywood were \"the kindred creative spirits\" he found behind the scenes at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The talent pool was especially large during World War II, when Hollywood was a refuge for many musicians and others in the performing arts of Europe who were forced to flee the Nazis. After the war, a new generation was coming of age. Those who sawAn American in Paris(1951) would try to make real life as romantic as the reel life they saw portrayed in that musical, and the first time they saw Paris, they were seeing again in memory the seventeen-minute ballet sequence set to the title song written byGeorge Gershwinand choreographed by Kelly. The sequence cost a half million dollars (U.S.) to make in 1951 dollars. Another Kelly musical of the era,Singin\' in the Rain(1952), was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for its National Film Registry. Kelly was in the same league asFred Astaire, but instead of a top hat and tails Kelly wore work clothes that went with his masculine, athletic dance style.Gene Kelly died at age 83 of complications from two strokes on February 2, 1996 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California.', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MzIyMDI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQ2MjU2.jpg', 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000037/'),

Broderick reprised the role of Eugene in \"Biloxi Blues\" (1988), the second installment of the Simon trilogy, for both the Broadway production and the film adaptation (Biloxi Blues(1988)). For the third and final installment of the trilogy, he was replaced byJonathan Silverman. In 1983, the same year asMax Dugan Returns(1983), Broderick had his first big-screen success in the light comedyWarGames(1983). Since then he has had his fair share of hits and misses, with some of his better films includingProject X(1987) also starringHelen Hunt, whom he subsequently dated;Addicted to Love(1997); andInspector Gadget(1999). Other films he has appeared in which may be known but not so much respected includeOut on a Limb(1992) with hisFerris Bueller\'s Day Off(1986) co-starJeffrey Jones;The Night We Never Met(1993);The Road to Wellville(1994); andThe Cable Guy(1996) withJim Carrey, which got him an MTV \"Best Fight\" award nomination; and the MTV filmElection(1999) withReese Witherspoon. In 1985 he was involved in a controversial car crash while driving in Ireland with his then fiancéeJennifer Grey. The crash killed a woman and her daughter. Broderick paid a small fine to the family of the victims. He broke his leg in the accident, which happened just asFerris Bueller\'s Day Off(1986), his biggest hit, was coming out in the US. The box office success (but critical flop) and special effects blockbusterGodzilla(1998) gave Broderick his first action role (should any \"Godzilla\" sequels be planned, he is under contract for two more). He has occasionally returned to the stage in New York, either in revivals of old musical warhorses such as \"How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying\" or in revivals of old \"show people\"plays, such as \"Night Must Fall\". In 1996 Broderick attempted to wear three hats as co-producer/director/actor inInfinity(1996), working very closely with his mother, who also wrote the screenplay. It was not a critical or commercial success, and he has not directed or produced since. Since May 1997 he has been married to actressSarah Jessica Parker. He was previously engaged to bothHelen Huntand datedLili Taylor. In 1999 he donned a trenchcoat for the children\'s filmInspector Gadget(1999), alongsideRupert Everettas the evil villain Claw. In March 2001 Broderick returned to Broadway in the musical smash \"The Producers\" (based on the 1968Mel Brooksfilm of the same name). He was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, which he lost to his co-star,Nathan Lane.', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NjA0MzM0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU5ODAxMw@@.jpg', 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000111/'),

DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcomGrowing Pains(1985) and low budget horror movies, such asCritters 3(1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such asRomeo + Juliet(1996) andTitanic(1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such asMartin ScorseseandChristopher Nolan.Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born November 11, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, the only child ofIrmelin DiCaprio(née Indenbirken) and former comic book artistGeorge DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \"Wilhelm\", was his maternal grandfather\'s first name. Leonardo\'s father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late \'Harvey Pekar\', a friend of George\'s. Leonardo\'s performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such asRoseanne(1988) andThe New Lassie(1989), but it wasn\'t until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut inCritters 3(1991), a low-budget horror movie. WhileCritters 3(1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio\'s acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcomGrowing Pains(1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio\'s stint onGrowing Pains(1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public\'s attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth inWhat\'s Eating Gilbert Grape(1993), a young gunslinger inThe Quick and the Dead(1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll inThe Basketball Diaries(1995), a role which the lateRiver Phoenixoriginally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo\'s reputation as an actor, it wasn\'t until his role as Romeo Montague inBaz Luhrmann\'sRomeo + Juliet(1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers,Titanic(1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time,Titanic(1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio\'s reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work onTitanic(1997), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles inThe Man in the Iron Mask(1998) and the low-budgetThe Beach(2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period.In 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles inCatch Me If You Can(2002) andGangs of New York(2002), his first of many collaborations with directorMartin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such asThe Departed(2006),Shutter Island(2010) andChristopher Nolan\'sInception(2010), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors.In 2012, he played a mustache-twirling villain inDjango Unchained(2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby inThe Great Gatsby(2013) and Jordan Belfort inThe Wolf of Wall Street(2013).DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MTg3MzI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQyODU2Mw@@.jpg', 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/'),

Harrison was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television (Ironside(1967),The Virginian(1962)) remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa inAmerican Graffiti(1973). Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo inStar Wars(1977). Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones inRaiders of the Lost Ark(1981).Four years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book inWitness(1985). All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan inPatriot Games(1992). Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble inThe Fugitive(1993). He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour, he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft he soloed in. Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope.On March 5, 2015, Ford\'s plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California.

Her mother, Emma (Harris), was a teacher and a nurse, and her father, Robert James Johnson, Jr., was a clergyman. Whoopi\'s recent ancestors were from Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. She worked in a funeral parlor and as a bricklayer while taking small parts on Broadway. She moved to California and worked with improv groups, including Spontaneous Combustion, and developed her skills as a stand-up comedienne. Goldberg came to prominence doing an HBO special and a one-woman show asMoms Mabley. She has been known in her prosperous career as a unique and socially conscious talent with articulately liberal views. Among her boyfriends wereTed DansonandFrank Langella. Goldberg was married three times and was once addicted to drugs.Goldberg had her first big film starring role inThe Color Purple(1985). She received much critical acclaim, and an Oscar nomination for her role and became a major star as a result. Subsequent efforts in the late 1980s were, at best, marginal hits. These movies mostly were off-beat to formulaic comedies likeBurglar(1987),The Telephone(1988) andJumpin\' Jack Flash(1986). She made her mark as a household name and a mainstay in Hollywood for her Oscar-winning role in the box office smashGhost(1990). Whoopi Goldberg was at her most famous in the early 1990s, making regular appearances onStar Trek: The Next Generation(1987). She admitted to being a huge fan of the originalStar Trek(1966) series and jumped at the opportunity to star in \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".Goldberg received another smash hit role inSister Act(1992). Her fish-out-of-water with some flash seemed to resonate with audiences and it was a box office smash. Whoopi starred in some highly publicized and moderately successful comedies of this time, includingMade in America(1993) andSoapdish(1991). Goldberg followed up to her success withSister Act 2: Back in the Habit(1993), which was well-received but did not seem to match up to the first.As the late 1990s approached, Goldberg seemed to alternate between lead roles in straight comedies such asEddie(1996) andThe Associate(1996), and took supporting parts in more independent minded movies, such asThe Deep End of the Ocean(1999) andHow Stella Got Her Groove Back(1998). Goldberg never forgot where she came from, hosting many tributes to other legendary entertainment figures. Her most recent movies includeRat Race(2001) and the quietly receivedKingdom Come(2001). Goldberg contributes her voice to many cartoons, includingThe Pagemaster(1994) andCaptain Planet and the Planeteers(1990), as Gaia, the voice of the earth. Alternating between big-budget movies, independent movies, tributes, documentaries, and even television movies (includingTheodore Rex(1995)).Whoopi is accredited as a truly unique and visible talent in Hollywood. Perhaps she will always be remembered as well for Comic Relief, playing an integral part in almost every benefit concert they had. Whoopi is also the center square inHollywood Squares(1998), sometimes hosts the Academy Awards, and is an author, with the book \"Book.\"', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4ODgzNjQwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzczNzc0.jpg', 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000155/'),

He planned to become a professional racecar driver. However, a terrible car accident just after his high school graduation ended that dream permanently. The accident changed his views on life.He decided to attend Modesto Junior College before enrolling in the University of Southern California film school. As a film student, he made several short films includingElectronic Labyrinth THX 1138 4EB(1967) which won first prize at the 1967-68 National Student Film Festival. In 1967, he was awarded a scholarship by Warner Brothers to observe the making ofFinian\'s Rainbow(1968) which was being directed byFrancis Ford Coppola. Lucas and Coppola became good friends and formed American Zoetrope in 1969. The company\'s first project was Lucas\' full-length version ofTHX 1138(1971). In 1971, Coppola went into production forThe Godfather(1972), and Lucas formed his own company, Lucasfilm Ltd.In 1973, he wrote and directed the semiautobiographicalAmerican Graffiti(1973) which won the Golden Globe and garnered five Academy Award nominations. This gave him the clout he needed for his next daring venture. From 1973 to 1974, he began writing the screenplay which becameStar Wars(1977). He was inspired to make this movie from Flash Gordon and the Planet of the Apes films. In 1975, he established ILM. (Industrial Light & Magic) to produce the visual effects needed for the movie. Another company called Sprocket Systems was established to edit and mix Star Wars and later becomes known as Skywalker Sound. His movie was turned down by several studios until 20th Century Fox gave him a chance. Lucas agreed to forego his directing salary in exchange for 40% of the film\'s box-office take and all merchandising rights. The movie went on to break all box office records and earned seven Academy Awards. It redefined the term \"blockbuster\" and the rest is history.Lucas made the other Star Wars films and along withSteven Spielbergcreated the Indiana Jones series which made box office records of their own. From 1980 to 1985, Lucas was busy with the construction of Skywalker Ranch, built to accommodate the creative, technical, and administrative needs of Lucasfilm.

He is the son ofPatricia Taylor, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu\'s father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry, and Keanu\'s mother is originally from England. After his parents\' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister,Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 wasPaul Aaron, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller and hair salon owner Jack Bond. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \"The Wall\") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in theRob Lowehockey flickYoungblood(1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics\' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama,River\'s Edge(1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominatedDangerous Liaisons(1988) with directorStephen Frears.His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted \"Theodore\" Logan inBill & Ted\'s Excellent Adventure(1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves\'s real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts ofRon Howard\'s comedy,Parenthood(1989) andLawrence Kasdan\'sI Love You to Death(1990).Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy oppositeRiver Phoenix\'s narcoleptic male hustler inMy Own Private Idaho(1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire\'s lair inDracula(1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John inMuch Ado About Nothing(1993).In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release ofSpeed(1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, likeFeeling Minnesota(1996) andThe Last Time I Committed Suicide(1997), and big films likeA Walk in the Clouds(1995) andThe Devil\'s Advocate(1997). (There were a couple misfires, too:Johnny Mnemonic(1995) andChain Reaction(1996).) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings\' cyberadventure,The Matrix(1999).Now a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among themThe Replacements(2000),The Watcher(2000),The Gift(2000),Sweet November(2001), andHard Ball(2001) - beforeThe Matrix Reloaded(2003) andThe Matrix Revolutions(2003) were both released in 2003.Since the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits withSomething\'s Gotta Give(2003),The Lake House(2006), andStreet Kings(2008). He\'s kept Matrix fans satiated with films such asConstantine(2005),A Scanner Darkly(2006), andThe Day the Earth Stood Still(2008).

He also directed another Asian-influenced project,Man of Tai Chi(2013).In 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge filmJohn Wick(2014), which became popular with critics and audiences alike.

His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale\'s childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice.His first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in \"The Nerd\". A role in the 1986 NBC mini-seriesAnastasia: The Mystery of Anna(1986) caughtSteven Spielberg\'s eye, leading to Bale\'s well-documented role inEmpire of the Sun(1987). For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor.Adjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared inKenneth Branagh\'s 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare\'sHenry V(1989) and starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version ofTreasure Island(1990). Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing inNewsies(1992),Swing Kids(1993),Little Women(1994),The Portrait of a Lady(1996),The Secret Agent(1996),Metroland(1997),Velvet Goldmine(1998),All the Little Animals(1998), andA Midsummer Night\'s Dream(1999). Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique.Bale roared into the next decade with a lead role inAmerican Psycho(2000), directorMary Harron\'s adaptation of the controversialBret Easton Ellisnovel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for \"Entertainment Weekly\" crowned Bale one of the \"Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures\" of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the \"Most Creative People in Entertainment\", and \"Premiere\" lauded him as one of the \"Hottest Leading Men Under 30\".Bale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remakeShaft(2000),Captain Corelli\'s Mandolin(2001), the balmyLaurel Canyon(2002), andReign of Fire(2002), a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders.Two more cult films followed:Equilibrium(2002) andThe Machinist(2004), the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale\'s physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60+ pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year.Bale\'s abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him inBatman Begins(2005), the first chapter inChristopher Nolan\'s definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure ofBatman & Robin(1997). A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing.Bale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman\'s phenomenal success:The New World(2005) andHarsh Times(2005). He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006\'sRescue Dawn(2006),Werner Herzog\'s feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary,Little Dieter Needs to Fly(1997). Leading up to the second Batman film, Bale starred inThe Prestige(2006), the remake of3:10 to Yuma(2007), and a reunion with directorTodd Haynesin the experimentalBob Dylanbiography,I\'m Not There(2007).Anticipation forThe Dark Knight(2008) was spun into unexpected heights with the tragic passing ofHeath Ledger, whose performance as The Joker became the highlight of the sequel. Bale\'s graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor.Bale\'s next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-lessTerminator Salvation(2009), followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis inMichael Mann\'sPublic Enemies(2009). Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be.For all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake ofThe Fighter(2010)\'s critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer \"Irish\" Micky Ward, played byMark Wahlberg. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation.Bale then turned to another auteur,Yimou Zhang, for the epicJin ling shi san chai(2011), in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking.

He left school at age 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England, he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertisedThe Caine Mutiny(1954). In the years that followed, he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit \"The Long and the Short and the Tall\".Zulu(1964), the epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although \"Zulu\" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer inThe Ipcress File(1965) and the title role inAlfie(1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-1960s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, includingGambit(1966),Funeral in Berlin(1966),Play Dirty(1969),Battle of Britain(1969),Too Late the Hero(1970),The Last Valley(1971) and especiallyGet Carter(1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command.However, there were some gems amongst the dross. He gave a magnificent performance oppositeSean ConneryinThe Man Who Would Be King(1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel inThe Eagle Has Landed(1976).Educating Rita(1983) andHannah and Her Sisters(1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recentlyLittle Voice(1998),The Cider House Rules(1999) (his second Oscar) andLast Orders(2001) have been widely acclaimed. Caine played Nigel Powers in the parody sequelAustin Powers in Goldmember(2002), and Alfred Pennyworth inChristopher Nolan\'s Dark Knight trilogy. He appeared in several other of Nolan\'s films includingThe Prestige(2006),Inception(2010) andInterstellar(2014). He also appeared as a supporting character inAlfonso Cuarón\'sChildren of Men(2006) and Pixar\'s sequelCars 2(2011).As of 2015, films in which Caine has starred have grossed over $7.4 billion worldwide. He is ranked the ninth highest grossing box office star. Caine is one of several actors nominated for an Academy Award for acting every decade from five consecutive decades (the other beingLaurence OlivierandMeryl Streep). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1992 Birthday Honours, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2000 Birthday Honours in recognition for his contributions to the cinema.', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzIwNTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzE1MTUz.jpg', 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323/'),

At the age of 10, he appeared in his first play, \"In My Many Names and Days,\" at a cramped little theater space in Manhattan. He continued on but managed to avoid the trappings of a child star per se, considering himself more a working child actor at the time. Billing himself as Larry Fishburne during this early phase, he never studied or was trained in the technique of acting. In 1973, at the age of 12, Laurence won a recurring role on the daytime soapOne Life to Live(1968) that lasted three seasons and subsequently made his film debut in the ghetto-themedCornbread, Earl and Me(1975). At 14Francis Ford Coppolacast him inApocalypse Now(1979), which filmed for two years in the Philippines. Laurence didn\'t work for another year and a half after that long episode. A graduate of Lincoln Square Academy, Coppola was impressed enough with Laurence to hire him again down the line with featured roles inRumble Fish(1983),The Cotton Club(1984), andGardens of Stone(1987).Throughout the 1980s, he continued to build up his film and TV credit list with featured roles despite little fanfare. A recurring role as Cowboy Curtis on the kiddie showPee-wee\'s Playhouse(1986) helped him through whatever lean patches there were at the time. With the new decade (1990s) came out-and-out stardom for Laurence. A choice lead inJohn Singleton\'s urban taleBoyz n the Hood(1991) catapulted him immediately into the front of the film ranks. Set in LA\'s turbulent South Central area, his potent role as a morally minded divorced father who strives to rise above the ignorance and violence of his surroundings, Laurence showed true command and the ability to hold up any film. On stage, he would become invariably linked to playwrightAugust Wilsonand his 20th Century epic African-American experience after starring for two years as the eruptive ex-con in \"Two Training Running.\" For this powerful, mesmerizing performance, Laurence won nearly every prestigious theater award in the books (Tony, Outer Critics Circle, Drama Desk and Theatre World). It was around the time of this career hallmark that he began billing himself as \"Laurence\" instead of \"Larry.\" More awards and accolades came his way. In addition to an Emmy for the pilot episode of the series \"Tribeca,\" he was nominated for his fine work in the quality mini-moviesThe Tuskegee Airmen(1995) andMiss Evers\' Boys(1997).On the larger screen, both Laurence andAngela Bassettwere given Oscar nominations for their raw, seething portrayals of rock stars Ike and Tina Turner in the filmWhat\'s Love Got to Do with It(1993). To his credit, he managed to take an extremely repellent character and make it a sobering and captivating experience. A pulp box-office favorite as well, he originated the role of Morpheus,Keanu Reeves\' mentor, in the exceedingly popular futuristic sci-fiThe Matrix(1999), best known for its ground-breaking special effects. He wisely returned for its back-to-back sequels. Into the millennium, Laurence extended his talents by making his screenwriting and directorial debut inOnce in the Life(2000), in which he also starred. The film is based on his own critically acclaimed play \"Riff Raff,\" which he staged five years earlier. In 1999, he scored a major theater triumph with a multi-racial version of \"The Lion in Winter\" as Henry II oppositeStockard Channing\'s Eleanor of Acquitaine. On film, Fishburne has appeared in a variety of interesting roles in not-always-successful films. Never less than compelling, a few of his more notable parts include an urban speed chess player inSearching for Bobby Fischer(1993); a military prisoner inCadence(1990); a college professor in Singleton\'sHigher Learning(1995); a CIA operative inBad Company(1995); the title role inOthello(1995) (he was the first black actor to play the part on film); a spaceship rescue team leader in the sci-fi horrorEvent Horizon(1997); a Depression-era gangster inHoodlum(1997); a dogged police sergeant inClint Eastwood\'sMystic River(2003); a spelling bee coach inAkeelah and the Bee(2006); and prominent roles in the mainstream filmsPredators(2010) andContagion(2011). He returned occasionally to the theatre. In April 2008, he played Thurgood Marshall in the one-man show \"Thurgood\" and won a Drama Desk Award. It was later transferred to the screen.In the fall of 2008, Fishburne replacedWilliam Petersenas the male lead investigator on the popular CBS dramaCSI: Crime Scene Investigation(2000), but left the show in 2011 to refocus on films and was in turn replaced byTed Danson. Since then Fishburne has appeared in the Superman filmMan of Steel(2013) as Daily Planet chief Perry White.Fishburne has two children, Langston and Montana, from his first marriage to actressHajna O. Moss.

His father was an officer in the Royal Engineers and the family followed him as his career posted him throughout the United Kingdom and Europe before they eventually returned to Teesside. Scott wanted to join the Royal Army (his elder brother Frank had already joined the Merchant Navy) but his father encouraged him to develop his artistic talents instead and so he went to West Hartlepool College of Art and then London\'s Royal College of Art where he helped found the film department.In 1962, he joined the BBC as a trainee set designer working on several high profile series. He attended a trainee director\'s course while he was there and his first directing job was on an episode of the popular BBC police seriesZ Cars(1962),Z Cars: Error of Judgement(1965). More TV work followed until, frustrated by the poor financial rewards at the BBC, he went into advertising. With his younger brother,Tony Scott, he formed the advertising production company RSA (Ridley Scott Associates) in 1967 and spent the next 10 years making some of the best known and best loved TV adverts ever shown on British television, including a series of ads for Hovis bread set to the music of Dvorak\'s New World Symphony which are still talked about today (\"\'e were a great baker were our dad.\")He began working with producerDavid Puttnamin the 1970s developing ideas for feature films. Their first joint endeavor,The Duellists(1977) won the Jury Prize for Best First Work at Cannes in 1977 and was nominated for the Palm d\'Or, more than successfully launching Scott\'s feature film career. The success ofStar Wars(1977) inspired Scott\'s interest in making science fiction and he accepted the offer to directDan O\'Bannon\'s low budget science fiction horror movieAlien(1979), a critical and commercial success that firmly established his worldwide reputation as a movie director.Blade Runner(1982) followed in 1982 to, at best, a lukewarm reception from public and critics but in the years that followed, its reputation grew - and Scott\'s with it - as one of the most important sci-fi movies ever made. Scott\'s next major project was back in the advertising world where he created another of the most talked-about advertising spots in broadcast history when his \"1984\"-inspired ad for the new Apple Macintosh computer was aired during the Super Bowl on January 22, 1984. Scott\'s movie career has seen a few flops (notablyLegend(1985) and1492: Conquest of Paradise(1992)), but with successes likeThelma & Louise(1991),Gladiator(2000) andBlack Hawk Down(2001) to offset them, his reputation remains solidly intact.Ridley Scott was awarded Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire at the 2003 Queen\'s New Year Honours for his \"substantial contribution to the British film industry\". On July 3, 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Royal College of Art in a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship in 2018.

Shweta is married, lives a non-filmy life and has two children.Being friends with Rajiv Gandhi, got him to decide to run for seat in the Congress from his hometown but had to leave midterm because of controversies, particularly after Rajiv and he were implicated in the now infamous \"Bofors\" case along with the U.K. based Hinduja Brothers.After a four year break, he was back in the unsuccessfulMrityudaata(1997), a comeback which the actor wanted to forget. Critics written him off but his career was saved withBade Miyan Chote Miyan(1998). But four flops in 1999 and incurring debt of over 90 Crores rupees of his sinking company ABCL saw him at an all-time low. To make matters worse, after the defeat of the Congress party, Amitabh lost considerable political support, the opposition made him a target, and his credit rating deteriorated to such an extent that a leading nationalized bank, Canara Bank, sued him for outstanding loans. He did bounce back, presenting the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire calledKaun Banega Crorepati?(2000). After a series of hits withMohabbatein(2000),Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...(2001) andBaghban(2003) andKhakee(2004), this elderly Bachchan is showing no signs of slowing down and proving the critics wrong once again.His son, Abhishek, is also an actor by his own rights.Amitabh and Jaya were interested in getting Abhishek married to Karishma, the daughter of Babita and Randhir Kapoor, they went through a formal engagement, but later broke it off.The former Miss World and Bollywood actress, Aishwarya Rai, and Abhishek, were formally engaged on Sunday January 14, 2007, at the Bachchan residence in Juhu, Bombay, with the marriage taking place at the Bachchan residence on April 20, 2007.On November 16, 2011, he became a Dada (Paternal Grandfather) when Aishwarya gave birth to a daughter in Mumbai Hospital. He is already a Nana (maternal grandfather) to Navya Naveli and Agastye - Shweta\'s children.He continues to be one of the busiest actors and singers in Bollywood as well as on TV, as can be seen from the commercials that he appears on, especially on Sahara One.

His parents, from the continental United States, were then serving as Children of God missionaries. His mother is from a Jewish family from New York, while his father, from California, is of mostly British Isles descent. As a youngster, Joaquin took his cues from older siblingsRiver PhoenixandRain Phoenix, changing his name to Leaf to match their earthier monikers. When the children were encouraged to develop their creative instincts, he followed their lead into acting. Younger sistersLiberty PhoenixandSummer Phoenixrounded out the talented troupe.The family moved often, traveling through Central and South America (and adopting the surname \"Phoenix\" to celebrate their new beginnings) but, by the time Joaquin was age 6, they had more or less settled in the Los Angeles area. Arlyn found work as a secretary at NBC, and John turned his talents to landscaping. They eventually found an agent who was willing to represent all five children, and the younger generation dove into television work. Commercials for meat, milk, and junk food were off-limits (the kids were all raised as strict vegans), but they managed to find plenty of work pushing other, less sinister products. Joaquin\'s first real acting gig was a guest appearance on River\'s sitcom,Seven Brides for Seven Brothers(1982).He worked with his brother again on the afterschool specialABC Afterschool Specials: Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia(1984), then struck out on his own in other made-for-TV productions. He made his big-screen debut as the youngest crew member in the interstellar rompSpaceCamp(1986), then won his first starring turn in the Cold War-era dramaRusskies(1987). In the late \'80s, the Phoenix clan decided to pull up stakes and relocate again--this time to Florida. River\'s film career had enough momentum to sustain the move, but Joaquin wasn\'t sure what lay in store for him in the Sunshine State. As it happened, Universal Pictures had just opened a new studio in the area and he was cast almost immediately as an angst-ridden adolescent inParenthood(1989). His performance was very well-received, but Joaquin decided to withdraw from acting for a while--he was frustrated with the dearth of interesting roles for actors his age, and he wanted to see more of the world.His parents were in the process of separating, so he struck out for Mexico with his father. Joaquin returned to the public eye three years later under tragic circumstances. On October 31, 1993, he was at The Viper Room (a Los Angeles nightclub partly-owned byJohnny Depp) when his brother River collapsed from a drug overdose and later died. Joaquin made the call to 911, which was rebroadcast on radio and television the world over. Months later, at the insistence of friends and colleagues, Joaquin began reading through scripts again, but he was reluctant to re-enter the acting life until he found just the right part. He finally signed up to work withGus Van Sant(who had directed River inMy Own Private Idaho(1991) andEven Cowgirls Get the Blues(1993)) to star asNicole Kidman\'s obsessive devotee inTo Die For(1995). The performance made Joaquin (who had dropped Leaf and reverted to his birth name) a critics\' darling in his own right.His follow-up turn inInventing the Abbotts(1997) scored more critical kudos and, perhaps more importantly, introduced him to his one-time fiancéeLiv Tyler. (The pair dated for almost three years.) He returned to the big screen later that year with a supporting role inOliver Stone\'sU Turn(1997), then played a locked-up drug scapegoat inReturn to Paradise(1998). He and \"Paradise\" co-starVince Vaughnre-teamed almost immediately for the small-town murder caperClay Pigeons(1998), which Joaquin followed with a turn as a porn store clerk in8MM(1999). The film that confirmed Phoenix as a star was the historical epicGladiator(2000). The Roman epic cast him as the selfish, paranoid young emperor Commodus oppositeRussell Crowe\'s swarthy hero. Determined to make his character as real as possible, Phoenix gained weight and cultivated a pasty complexion during the shoot. He received international attention and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for that role.Later that year, he appeared in two indies, playing a dock worker inThe Yards(2000) (which he counts among his favorite experiences--and one of the only films of his that he can sit through) and the priest in charge of the Marquis de Sade\'s asylum inQuills(2000). He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as the legendary musicianJohnny Cashin the biographyWalk the Line(2005).

He later recalled that the only thing he wanted to be was a tap dancer.He was born in Columbia, South Carolina, to Helen Pauline (Cohen) and Mordecai Moses Donen, a dress-shop manager, of Russian-Jewish and German-Jewish descent. Donen debuted on Broadway at seventeen. While working as an assistant choreographer in 1941, he met and befriended the actorGene Kelly, Kelly being the brash, extrovert and energetic side of the burgeoning partnership, Donen the more refined and relaxed. Three years later, the two men renewed their collaboration in Hollywood and did much to reinvigorate the musical genre. For the next decade, they worked side-by-side as choreographers and co-directors (a relationship Donen described as \'wonderful\' but \'also trying at times\'), linked to MGM\'sArthur Freedunit. Between them, they directed classic musicals likeOn the Town(1949) andSingin\' in the Rain(1952) and co-wrote the original story forTake Me Out to the Ball Game(1949). Freed, by the way, was the producer almost single-handedly responsible for the high standard of MGM\'s A-grade musicals in the 40s and 50s. A former vaudevillian and song-plugger, Freed was an astute judge of talent and encouraged gifted individuals from other media (like radio or theatre) to become involved with pictures. Moreover, he gave artists like Kelly and Donen free rein to express their creative flair.In 1949, MGM signed Donen to a seven-year contract as director in his own right. From then on, he and Kelly went their separate ways. After directingSeven Brides for Seven Brothers(1954), Donen moved on to Paramount forFunny Face(1957), then to Warner Brothers forThe Pajama Game(1957) andDamn Yankees(1958). As musicals waned in popularity, Donen branched out into other genres. He began to direct and produce elegant, lavish romantic dramas like the delightfulIndiscreet(1958), sophisticated comedies likeThe Grass Is Greener(1960) andTwo for the Road(1967) (which starred Donen\'s favorite actress,Audrey Hepburn), as well as the top-shelf thrillersCharade(1963) (the best filmAlfred Hitchcocknever directed, again with Hepburn) andArabesque(1966). Arguably, his most out-of-character film from this period was the esoteric mephistophelean (and very British) farceBedazzled(1967), featuring the irrepressible comic talents ofPeter CookandDudley Moore.The 1970s heralded a steady decline in the quality of Donen\'s output. None of his later efforts seemed to have the panache of his earlier work: not the tepid adventure-comedyLucky Lady(1975) (despite a good cast and sumptuous production look) nor the nostalgic musical fantasyThe Little Prince(1974), based on the book byAntoine de Saint-Exupéry. A failure at the box office, the latter also marked the end of theFrederick Loewe-Alan Jay Lernermusical partnership. Donen\'s career may have finished on a low with a weak sojourn into science fiction that wasSaturn 3(1980) and the absolutely dreadful comedyBlame It on Rio(1984), but his reputation as one of the giants of the classic Hollywood musical is assured. Donen received an Honorary Oscar in 1998 \"\"for a body of work marked by grace, elegance, wit, and visual innovation.\'\'', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ0MDgxNzEtYWUyZC00MjhkLThmOTItOTU5ZmZjYTg4Zjc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUxODE0MDY@.jpg', 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002045/'),

Sunil Dutt wore many hats and excelled in a plethora of roles that came his way - both on and off screen.Born on June 6th, 1929, Sunil Dutt grew up as Balraj Dutt in a family that had survived the Partition of India. A student of Mumbai\'s Jai Hind college, he first started off as radio show host and celebrity interviewer, which led to his first encounter with the glamor world.Interestingly, wife-to-be Nargis was one of the celebrities he met in the course of his work. Soon, Dutt got a chance to enter the film-world, when director Ramesh Saigal offered him the hero\'s role in his Nalini Jaywant starrer \'Railway Platform\' (1955).\'Ek Hi Raasta\' (1956), marked the start of a seven-film long association with B R Chopra. Dutt\'s true breakthrough came with Mehboob Khan\'s magnum opus \'Mother India\' (1957).His portrayal of Birju, Nargi\'s rebellious younger son, portrayed a raw, urgent energy. Dutt\'s association with Nargis in the movie resulted in a more serious one, when he married her after the release of the film.Dutt\'s role in women-oriented films like \'Sadhna\' (1958), \'Sujata\' (1959) and \'Main Chup Rahungi\' (1962) were well-appreciated. Noted filmmakers like Bimal Roy, Hrishikesh Mukherji and B R Chopra dared to defy Sunil Dutt\'s established rebellious Birju image and cast him as a sensitive lover.Dutt turned producer in the early sixties with a couple of offbeat movies - \'Yeh Raaste Hain Pyar Ke\' (1963), where heroine Leela Naidu has an adulterous relationship and \'Mujhe Jeene Do\' (1963) where he played a dacoit.In his cinematic association with B R Chopra, Dutt gave three big hits in the sixties - \'Gumraah\' (1963), \'Waqt\' (1965) and \'Humraaz\' (1967). He also worked with South Indian filmmakers, which resulted in emotion-heavy, rural-based hits with Nutan like \'Khandaan\' and \'Milan\'.In 1967, he had a hat-trick of hits with \'Milan\', \'Meherban\' and \'Humraaz\'. His role of a buffoon in Mehmood\'s \'Padosan\' (1968) was much appreciated.In 1981, Dutt\'s world was rocked when his wife Nargis died after a protracted battle with her cancer. He later joined politics and social work.But the actor in Dutt continued to surface during the last decade with movies with select filmmakers like J P Dutta \'Kshatriya\' and Yash Chopra \'Parampara\'. His last screen cameo was in Rajkumar Hirani\'s immensely popular laugh riot \'Munnabhai MBBS\', where he played on-screen father to his son Sanjay.', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM0OTA3MDAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg2OTczOTE@.jpg', 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004570/');

He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. His work comprised nineteen films, including10 Things I Hate About You(1999),The Patriot(2000),A Knight\'s Tale(2001),Monster\'s Ball(2001),Ned Kelly(2003),The Brothers Grimm(2005),Lords of Dogtown(2005),Brokeback Mountain(2005),Casanova(2005),Candy(2006),I\'m Not There(2007),The Dark Knight(2008) andThe Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus(2009). He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.Heath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, to Sally (Ramshaw), a teacher of French, and Kim Ledger, a mining engineer who also raced cars. His ancestry was Scottish, English, Irish, and Sephardi Jewish. As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break.His first real acting job came in a low-budget movie calledBlackrock(1997), a largely unimpressive cliché; an adolescent angst film about one boy\'s struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He only had a very small role in the film. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show calledSweat(1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He was offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, forcing him to look for other roles. He was inHome and Away(1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role inPaws(1997), a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigyNathan Cavaleri\'s brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played \"Oberon\". A very brief role, this offered him a small paycheck but did nothing to advance his career. Then cameTwo Hands(1999). He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role inRoar(1997) opposite then unknownVera Farmiga.Then Australian directorGregor Jordanauditioned him for the lead inTwo Hands(1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller,Two Hands(1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in10 Things I Hate About You(1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war dramaThe Patriot(2000).What followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role inMonster\'s Ball(2001), but his version ofNed Kelly(2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role inBrokeback Mountain(2005). For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in in the film, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for the Academy Award for Best Actor.Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. His death occurred during editing ofThe Dark Knight(2008) and in the midst of filming his last role as Tony inThe Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus(2009).Posthumously, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the filmI\'m Not There(2007), which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriterBob Dylan. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan\'s life and persona.A few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in \'The Dark Knight(2008). His untimely death cast a somber shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $185 million Batman production. Ledger received more than thirty posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance as the Joker, the psychopathic clown prince of crime, in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he is the second actor to win an acting award posthumously after Peter Finch who won an Oscar for Network (Best Actor 1977)), the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2NTY0NzA4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE1MDE0.jpg', 'https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005132/'),

At age 20, after studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, she moved to Europe to pursue a career in modeling. While in Spain she was cast in a regular role in the TV show Dark Justice which was produced in Barcelona for its first season. She followed the series to its new shooting location in Los Angeles the next year. Once in LA she began getting more opportunities, one of which was a TV series Matrix (which coincidentally presaged the movie that would later make her famous), another was being cast as a series regular for Aaron Spelling\'s television spectacle Models Inc.Carrie-Anne\'s work was already gaining traction throughout the motion picture casting community when the late great casting director Mali Finn invited Carrie-Anne to audition for The Wachowski\'s and their top secret sci-fi action project; that activated her explosive film career. The writer/directors recognized Carrie-Anne\'s empowered yet openhearted leading qualities and following a challenging process of physical and character screen tests they ultimately gave her the opportunity to create the iconic cyber warrior \"Trinity\" in the record breaking, award winning and internationally successful The Matrix trilogy for Warner Bros/Village Roadshow. Her extraordinary performance launched her on to the world stage alongside her \"One\" Keanu Reeves, in stride with Laurence Fishburne and the multifaceted Hugo Weaving. Carrie-Anne Moss galvanized her place in cinematic history as the first woman to triumphantly fight her way through one of the highest grossing sci-fi action franchises of all time.Directly following her phenomenal new-found success Carrie-Anne received a wide range of scripts from studios and A-list filmmakers but it was the complex screenplay Memento that stirred her creative senses. After meeting the then unknown writer/director Christopher Nolan it was without hesitation that she accepted the role of \"Natalie\" in Nolan\'s directorial debut. Starring opposite the unforgettable Guy Pearce, and produced by Jennifer & Suzanne Todd, Memento became one of the most critically acclaimed and, at that time, the largest grossing independent film in history. Carrie-Anne Moss\'s remarkable performance won her the coveted Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female that year.Many of Hollywood\'s prominent directors and producers continued to pursue her for films; she survived the Red Planet for Warner Bros; sweetened Lasse Hallström\'s multi Oscar nominated Chocolat with Juliette Binoche, Dame Judi Dench and Johnny Depp; and tracked Suspect Zero alongside Aaron Eckhart and the elusive Sir Ben Kingsley in the Cruise/Wagner produced film.But it was over the next years that Carrie-Anne took on the most important and rewarding role of her life, becoming a mother to her three children. During that same time Carrie-Anne also mothered on screen the watchful Shia LaBeouf in the rear window-esque DreamWorks box-office hit Disturbia; and together with Samuel L. Jackson, led the intense terrorist interrogation of Michael Sheen in Sony\'s Unthinkable.Carrie-Anne continued to accept many other lead roles on interesting film projects including The Chumscrubber with Ralph Fiennes and Glenn Close; the comedy noir Mini\'s First Time also starring Alec Baldwin and Luke Wilson; Snow Cake the touching drama with Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman; Fireflies in the Garden in the company of Ryan Reynolds, Julia Roberts and Willem Defoe; and the retro zombie rom-com Fido along with Billy Connelly and Dylan Baker. It is Carrie-Anne\'s inclination towards thought-provoking filmmakers that has inspired her to lend her success to many other indie projects including Normal, Silent Hill, Elephant Song, Pompeii, Brain on Fire, The Bye Bye Man and more...Throughout her career, Carrie-Anne has been attracted to compelling television projects as well, like Ryan Murphy\'s, before its time, one hour FOX pilot Pretty Handsome where she played the curious wife to a cross-dressing Joseph Fiennes while dealing with her society mother-in-law Blythe Danner; CBS\'s Vegas a sin city period piece playing Nevada\'s first woman District Attorney for James Mangold and Nicholas Pileggi, which also starred the lawful Dennis Quaid and gaming Michael Chiklis; and a guest starring arc throughout the second season of AMC\'s Humans, experimenting as a highly regarded scientist with a deeply personal agenda, working alongside Gemma Chan.Carrie-Anne Moss has recently completed her third and final season as the powerful and enduring attorney \"Jerry Hogarth\" navigating her way through the Marvel universe in Jessica Jones for Netflix opposite Krysten Ritter and for show runner Melissa Rosenberg. In between seasons she tucked into the first bi-lingual English/Norwegian detective crime series Wisting, as an FBI agent that is following the leads to catch a serial killer in the Norwegian landscape.

Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is congressmanMike Capuano. Chris\'s father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris\'s mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister,Carly Evans, and two younger siblings, a brother namedScott Evans, who is also an actor, and a sister namedShana Evans. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter\'s Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended theLee StrasbergTheatre Institute.On the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances onThe Fugitive(2000) (CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starringHarrison Ford. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles inCherry Falls(2000) andThe Newcomers(2000) - two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared inBoston Public(2000) (Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature,Not Another Teen Movie(2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen.After filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful -Just Married(2003) andEastwick(2002) - he appeared in another listless teen comedy,The Perfect Score(2004), playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller,Cellular(2004), a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman\'s life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans andKim Basingeras the damsel in distress,Cellular(2004) failed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm inFantastic Four(2005), 20th Century Fox\'s long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television\'s 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.The year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance.The Nanny Diaries(2007), where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans\' part of the movieStreet Kings(2008), playing the character Detective Paul Diskant.

Mark moved with his family to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where he lived out most of his teenage years. Following high school, Mark moved with his family to San Diego and soon migrated north, eventually settling in Los Angeles. He took classes at the Stella Adler Conservatory and subsequently co-founded the Orpheus Theatre Company, an Equity-Waiver establishment, where he worked in nearly every capacity. From acting, writing, directing and producing to running the lights and building sets while building his resume. Bartending for nearly nine years to make ends meet and ready to give it all up, a chance meeting and resulting collaboration with playwright/screenwriterKenneth Lonerganchanged everything.Ruffalo won NY success in Lonergan\'s play \"This Is Our Youth\", which led to the male lead in Lonergan\'s filmYou Can Count on Me(2000), playing the ne\'er-do-well brother ofLaura Linney. The performance drew rave reviews and invited comparisons to an earlyMarlon Brando. Notable roles inThe Last Castle(2001),XX/XY(2002), andWindtalkers(2002) followed, although in 2002 Ruffalo was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, a type of brain tumor. Though the tumor was benign, the resulting surgery led to a period of partial facial paralysis, from which he fully recovered. In 2003, Ruffalo scored leading roles alongside two popular female stars, playing a police detective oppositeMeg RyaninIn the Cut(2003) and the love interest ofGwyneth Paltrowin the comedyView from the Top(2003). Though both films were high-profile box office disappointments, Ruffalo went on to four notable (if highly disparate) films in 2004 -We Don\'t Live Here Anymore(2004),Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind(2004),13 Going on 30(2004), andCollateral(2004) - which solidified his ability to be both a popular leading man and an acclaimed ensemble player in either comedy or drama.After 2004, Ruffalo was consistently at work, with leads in popular Hollywood films and independent productions that continued to solidify him as one of film\'s most consistently strong actors:Just Like Heaven(2005),All the King\'s Men(2006),Zodiac(2007),Reservation Road(2007), andThe Brothers Bloom(2008). In 2010 Ruffalo achieved something of a breakthrough, by directing the indie filmSympathy for Delicious(2010), which won him the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and co-starring as the sperm-donor father to lesbian coupleAnnette BeningandJulianne MooreinThe Kids Are All Right(2010).

Hugo has an older brother, Simon, and a younger sister, Anna, who both also live and work in Australia. During his early childhood, the Weaving family spent most of their time traveling between Nigeria, Great Britain, and Australia. This was due to the cross-country demands of his father\'s job in the computer industry. Later, during his teens, Hugo spent three years in England in the seventies attending Queen Elizabeth\'s Hospital School in Bristol. There, he showed early promise in theater productions and also excelled at history, achieving an A in his O-level examination. He arrived permanently in Australia in 1976 and finished his education at Knox Grammar School, Sydney. He graduated from NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art), a college well-known for other alumni such asMel GibsonandGeoffrey Rush, in 1981. Since then, Hugo has had a steadily successful career in the film, television, and theater industries. However, he has illustrated that, as renowned as he is known for his film work, he feels most at home on stage and continually performs in Australian theater productions, usually with the Sydney Theater Company. With his success has also come extensive recognition. He has won numerous awards, including two Australian Film Institute Awards (AFI) for Best Actor in a Leading Role and three total nominations. The AFI is the Australian equivalent of an Academy Award, and Hugo won for his performances inProof(1991) andThe Interview(1998). He was also nominated for his performance inThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert(1994). He garnered the Best Acting prize forThe Interview(1998) at the Montreal Film Festival in 1998 in addition to his AFI Award and, that same year, won the Australian Star of the Year. More recently, roles in films such as The Matrix trilogy as Agent Smith and The Lord of the Rings trilogy as Lord Elrond have considerably raised his international profile.
